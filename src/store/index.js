            abortion: 'He’s against abortions except in three instances: rape, incest, and if the mother’s life is at risk. And his administration implemented rules that would make it easier for healthcare workers to refuse to perform abortions and other services if they violate their religious or moral beliefs.',
            education: 'He’s in favor of school vouchers, which give students public funds to go to non-public schools (think: private or charter). He also wants to fix the student loan crisis by doing two things. One: capping the amount of student loan debt students and parents can take on. Two: reducing the number of repayment plans available to them.',
            immigration: 'He still hasn’t gotten his wall, but he’s still trying to get more funding for border security, which would go to things like aid for unaccompanied minors. He’s also tried to end asylum protections for most migrants who arrive at the US-Mexico border.',
            criminal_justice: 'Last year, he signed a criminal justice reform bill that did things like lower certain mandatory minimum sentences and ensure that inmates are within 500 miles of family. He also made headlines for commuting the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who was serving a life sentence for a first-time, non-violent drug offense.',
            health_care: 'He’s planning to roll out big plans for it soon. For now, he’s promising to protect people with pre-existing conditions. He’s also proposed lowering funding for Medicaid and Medicare. And don’t ask him how he feels about the Affordable Care Act.',
            economy: 'One thing he’s especially proud of is the Republican tax plan, which was the biggest tax rewrite in decades. And during his first term, the unemployment rate has dropped to a 50-year low. He’s also made moves that he says will help keep US jobs at home (see: steel and aluminum tariffs, ditching the Trans-Pacific Partnership). Expect this to be another big talking point on the campaign trail.',
